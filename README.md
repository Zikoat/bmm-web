# BMM Nuxt experiment

I wanted to try implementing the new BMM project in Nuxt instead of pure Vite, as I really enjoy the conventions of Nuxt and all the nice DX that comes out of them.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Check out the [deployment documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for more information.
